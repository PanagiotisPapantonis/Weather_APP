# Weather_APP

This repository contains the HTML/CSS & JS source code for a Weather website.

The website is connected with openWeather.org via its weather API and providing the user
with information about the Temperature, Weather ,Humidity and Wind speed of the location he searched.
Additionally , after every search the background switches with the help of Unsplash to a random image
of the users input using another API.

The coordination and guidance for its realization was done by the IEEE Student Branch of University of Western Macedonia, Kastoria.


Future goals and development : 
1) Displaying the weather of the User's region-City by reading his IP address.
